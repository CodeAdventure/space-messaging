# Rock solid messaging infrastructure for Meteor. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodeAdventure/space-messaging.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodeAdventure/space-messaging)

This package provides the infrastructure to build your Meteor applications
around rock solid messaging principles that make your code strongly checked
and thus reduces errors caused by API changes within the system.

## Installation
`meteor add space:messaging`

## Documentation
Please look through the tests to get a feeling what this package can do for you.
I hope to find time to write some more documentation together soon ;-)

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
Add unit / integration tests for any new or changed functionality.

## Run the tests
`meteor test-packages ./`

## Release History
You can find the release history in the [changelog](https://github.com/CodeAdventure/space-messaging/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
